"""Render TRACK.md and track.json from the submissions in this repository.

    python3 scripts/render_track.py
    python3 scripts/render_track.py --check     # CI: fail if either is stale

NO COURSE CHECKOUT. That is the whole point of `items.json`, which the course
generates and ships here: the ids, the titles, whether an item is scored and
what it is out of. No answers, no checkers, no exercise bodies. It is the
denominator, and without it a blank cell cannot be told from a zero.

A PURE FOLD. Everything here is computed from `items.json` and the merged
`submissions/` tree, so regenerating from a clean checkout reproduces both files
byte for byte. If they ever differ, the submissions are right and these were
stale. Never hand-edit them.

IT NEVER RUNS A NOTEBOOK. It parses JSON and nothing else, which is why it can
run in a job holding a write token while the pull-request check, which sees
unmerged content from a fork, holds nothing at all. Since 2026-09-22 it does
READ the notebooks of two items per learner (ch05, ch10) as JSON, for one
printed line: the weekly challenge's points. See `session_challenge`.
